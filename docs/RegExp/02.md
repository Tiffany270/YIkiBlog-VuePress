## Lookarounds
key words : Lookbehinds, lookaheads
|Symbol|Description|
|:----:|----|
|?=|Positive Lookahead|
|?!|Negative Lookahead|
|?<=|Positive Lookbehind|
|?<!|Negative Lookbehind|
- specific types of `non-capturing` groups (used to match a pattern but without including it in the matching list)
-  Lookarounds are used when a pattern must be `preceded` or `followed` by another pattern

### Positive Lookahead
`  ?=  `
- The positive lookahead asserts that the `first` part of the expression must be `followed` by the `lookahead` expression
- `(T|t)he(?=\sfat)` means: match either a lowercase t or an uppercase T, followed by the letter he, to match `The` or `the` only if it's `followed` by the word ` fat` ( `\s` =  whitespace )
  > "(T|t)he(?=\sfat)" => `The` fat cat sat on the mat.

### Negative Lookahead
`  ?!  `
- Negative lookaheads are used when we need to get `all` matches from an input string that are `not` followed by a certain pattern
  > "(T|t)he(?!\sfat)" => The fat cat sat on `the` mat.

### Positive Lookbehind
`  ?<=  `
- Positive lookbehinds are used to get `all` the matches that are `preceded` by a specific pattern
- `(?<=(T|t)he\s)(fat|mat)` means: get all `fat` or `mat` words from the input string that `come after` the word `The` or `the`
  > "(?<=(T|t)he\s)(fat|mat)" => The `fat` cat sat on the `mat`.

### Negative Lookbehind
`  ?<!  `
- Negative lookbehinds are used to get `all` the matches that are `not` preceded by a specific pattern
- `(?<!(T|t)he\s)(cat)` means: get all `cat` words from the input string that are `not` after the word `The` or `the`
  > "(?<!(T|t)he\s)(cat)" => The cat sat on `cat`.

## Flags
key words: modifiers , RegExp
|Flag|Description|
|:----:|----|
|i|Case insensitive: Match will be case-insensitive|
|g|Global Search: Match all instances, not just the first|
|m|Multiline: Anchor meta characters work on each line|

### Case Insensitive
`  /i  `
> "The" => `The` fat cat sat on the mat.  
> "/The/gi" => `The` fat cat sat on `the` mat.

###  Global Search
` /g  `
