# Everyday Types

::: tip
I will skip for all those primitives such as string/number/boolean/symbol, because they're not really different from JS
:::
- but with `annotations` on ur Variables, it's totally different way from JS
``` ts
let myName: string = "Alice";

// in js
let myName = "Alice";
```
## any
- `special` type in TS, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors
- When you don’t specify a type, and TypeScript can’t infer it from context, the compiler will typically `default` to `any`
``` ts
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed 
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```
- Use the compiler flag `noImplicitAny` to flag any implicit any as an error.

## Object 
- `Optional` Properties with `?`
``` ts
// The parameter's type annotation is an object type
function printCoord(pt: { x?: number; y: number }) { // x is optional
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });
```

## Union
``` ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    // In this branch, id is of type 'string'
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // Here, id is of type 'number'
    console.log(id);
  }
}
```

## Type Aliases
- A type alias is exactly that a `name` for any type
``` ts
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
 
// Exactly the same as the earlier example
function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("y value is " + pt.y);
}
// use a type alias to give a name to any type at all
 type ID = number | string;
```
- Note that aliases are only aliases - you `cannot` use type aliases to create `different/distinct “versions”` of the same type
  - in my undertanding, it may says that like `type p = string, t:p = "test" ` still illegal
  - Can still be `re-assigned `with `same type` though
- A type `cannot` be changed after being `created`
``` ts
type Window = {
  title: string
}
type Window = {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI
}
 // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Window'.

```
- `Extending` a type via `intersections &`
``` ts
type Animal = {
  name: string
}
type Bear = Animal & { 
  honey: boolean 
}
const bear = getBear();
bear.name;
bear.honey;
```

## Interfaces
- An `interface` declaration is `another` way to name an `object` type

- `Extending` an interface
``` ts
interface Animal {
  name: string
}
interface Bear extends Animal {
  honey: boolean
}
const bear = getBear() 
bear.name
bear.honey
``` 
- `Adding` new fields
``` ts
interface Window {
  title: string
}
interface Window {
  ww: TypeScriptAPI
}
// Duplicate identifier 'Window' are illegal
const src = 'const a = "Hello World"';
window.ww.transpileModule(src, {});
```
## Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces
- a type `cannot` be re-opened to `add` new properties 
- an `interface` which is always `extendable`
- A type `cannot` be changed after being `created`
- If you would like a `heuristic`, use `interface` until you need to use features from `type`.

## Type Assertions
``` ts
const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
const myCanvas = <HTMLCanvasElement>document.getElementById("main_canvas");
```
- disallow more complex coercions, can use `two` assertions
```ts
// first to any (or unknown, which we’ll introduce later), then to the desired type
const a = (expr as any) as T;
```
