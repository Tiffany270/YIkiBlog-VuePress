# Classes
::: tip
Welcome to CLASS chapter!  
TypeScript adds type `annotations` and `other syntax` to allow you to express relationships between classes and other types
::: 
`Getters / Setters` `implements` `extends` `public` `protected` `private` `Static` `abstract`
``` ts
class Point {
  readonly name: string = "world";
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
 
const pt = new Point();
pt.x = 0;
pt.y = 0;
```
---
- `strictPropertyInitialization` setting `OFF/ON` 
  - controls whether class fields `need` to be `initialized` in the `constructor`
``` ts
class GoodGreeter {
  name: string;
 
  constructor() {
    this.name = "hello"; // initialized
  }
}
```

## Super Calls
-  if you have a `base` class, you’ll need to call `super()` in your `constructor` body before using any this. members
``` ts
class Base {
  k = 4;
}
class Derived extends Base {
  constructor() {
    super(); // before everything
    console.log(this.k);
  }
}
```

## Accessors
``` ts
class C {
  _length = 0;
  get length() {
    return this._length;
  }
  set length(value) {
    this._length = value;
  }
```
- some special inference `rules` 
  - If `get` exists but no `set`, the property is automatically `readonly`
  - If the type of the `setter` parameter is `not` specified, it is `inferred` from the `return` type of the `getter`
  - `Getters` and `setters` must have the `same` [Member Visibility](#member-visibility) 

## Member Visibility
`public` `protected` `private`
- control whether certain methods or properties are `visible` to code outside the class
--- 
- `public`
  - default
  - can be accessed anywhere
  - you `don’t` ever need to write it on a class member, but might choose to do so for `style/readability reasons`( let's sb know  exactly )
---
- `protected`
  - only visible to `subclasses` of the class they’re declared in
  - we need to be `careful` to `repeat` the `protected` modifier if this exposure isn’t intentional.
``` ts
class f {
  public greet(){}
  protected getName() {return "hi";}
}
class p extends f {
  public howdy() {
    console.log("Howdy, " + this.getName()); // from class f
  }
}
const g = new p();
g.greet(); // OK
g.getName(); // error
// ----
class Base {
  protected x: number = 1;
}
class Derived1 extends Base {
  protected x: number = 5;
}
class Derived2 extends Base {
  f1(other: Base) {
    other.x = 10; // error
  }
  f2(other: Derived1) {
    other.x = 10;  // error
  }
  f3(other: Derived2) {
    other.x = 10;
  }
}
```
---
- `private`
  - `doesn’t` allow access to the member `even` from `subclasses`
---
- some policy
  - `private` and `protected` are only enforced during `type checking` (means in js file thoes modifies aren't working ... )
  - `private` also allows access using `["bracket notation"]` during type checking
  - If you need to `protect` values in your class from malicious actors, you should use mechanisms that offer `hard` runtime privacy, such as `closures`, `WeakMaps`, or `private` fields. Note that these added privacy checks during runtime could `affect` performance.

## Index Signatures
-  NOTE that it’s `better` to store indexed data in `another` place instead of on the class instance itself
``` ts
class MyClass {
  [s: string]: boolean | ((s: string) => boolean);
 
  check(s: string) {
    return this[s] as boolean;
  }
}
```

## Class Heritage
`implements` `extends` `super`
- Like other languages with object-oriented features, classes in JavaScript can inherit from base classes
---
- `implements`
  - it's only a `check` that the class can be treated as the `interface` type. It `doesn’t` change the type of the class or its methods `at all`
  - `implementing` an `interface` with an optional property `doesn’t` create that property
``` ts
interface A {
  x: number;
  y?: number;
  check(name: string): boolean;
}
class C implements A {
  x = 0;
  check(s) {
  return s.toLowercse() === "ok"; // Notice no error here
  }
}
const c = new C();
c.y = 10; // error
```
---
- `extends`
  - Classes may extend from a base class. A derived class has `all` the `properties` and `methods` of its base class, and also define `additional` members
  - A derived class can also `override` a base class field or property, note that it not simply repeat a method but use `super.`
- remember that JavaScript classes are a simple `lookup` object, looking up like a chain
``` ts
class Base {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
}
class Derived extends Base {
  greet(name?: string) { // name must optional
    if (name === undefined) {
      super.greet(); // override
    } else {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
    }
  }
}
 
const d = new Derived();
d.greet(); // Hello, world!
d.greet("reader"); // Hello, reader
```
## Static Members
- NOTE: `NO` Static Classes, `only` members
- static members `aren’t` associated with a particular `instance` of the class. They can be `accessed` through the class `constructor` object itself ( means you can access those fields `without` creating an instance of the class)
- static members can `also` use the same `public`, `protected`, and `private` visibility modifiers
``` ts
class MyClass {
  static x = 0;
  static printX() {
    console.log(MyClass.x);
  }
}
console.log(MyClass.x);
MyClass.printX();
```
- `Function` properties like `name`, `length`, and `call` aren’t valid to define as static members
``` ts
class S {
  static name = "S!"; // error
// Static property 'name' conflicts with built-in property 'Function.name' of constructor function 'S'
}
```
--- 
- static Blocks
  - we can write `initialization` code with all the capabilities of writing static Blocks
``` ts
class Foo {
    static #count = 0;
    get count() {
        return Foo.#count;
    }
    static {
        try {
           ...
        }
        catch {}
    }
}
```
- [different static and non-static](/TypeScript/#some-confusions)

## Generic Classes
``` ts
class Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
  constructor(value: Type) {
    this.contents = value;
  }
}
//const b: Box<string>
const b = new Box("hello!");
```

## this 
- the value of `this` inside a function depends on how the function was `called`
``` ts
class MyClass {
  name = "MyClass";
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
}
const c = new MyClass();
const obj = { // the function was called through the `obj` reference
  name: "obj",
  getName: c.getName, 
};
console.log(obj.getName()); // "ojb"
```
- TypeScript provides some ways to `mitigate` or `prevent` this kind of error
---
- `Arrow Functions`
  - when a function that will `often` be called in a way that `loses` its this context
``` ts
class MyClass {
  name = "MyClass";
  getName = () => { // arrow func
    return this.name;
  };
}
const c = new MyClass();
console.log(c.getName()); // "MyClass"
```
---
- `this` as `parameters`
  - an add a `this` parameter to method `definitions` to statically `enforce` that the method is called `correctly`
``` ts
class MyClass {
  name = "MyClass";
  getName(this: MyClass) {
    return this.name;
  }
}
const c = new MyClass();
c.getName();// OK
const g = c.getName;
console.log(g());// Error
```
---
- `this` as `Types`
  - a special type called `this` refers `dynamically` to the type of the current class
``` ts
class Box {
  ...
  set(value: string) {
    ...
    return this;
  }
}
```

## Parameter Properties
`public` `private` `protected` `readonly`
- special syntax for turning a `constructor` parameter into a class property with the same name and value
``` ts
class Params {
  constructor(
    public readonly x: number,
    protected y: number,
    private z: number
  ) {
    // No body necessary
  }
}
const a = new Params(1, 2, 3);
console.log(a.x);
```
## abstract Classes and Members
`abstract`
- An abstract `method` or abstract `field` is one that hasn’t had an `implementation` provided. These members `must` exist inside an abstract class, which `cannot` be directly `instantiated`
``` ts
abstract class Base {
  abstract getName(): string;
  printName() {
    console.log(this.getName())
  }
}
const b = new Base();// error
class t extends Base {
  getName() { //can't forget this
    return "world";
  }
}
const d = new t();
d.printName();// "world"
```
---
- Sometimes you want to `accept` some class constructor function that produces an `instance` of a class which `derives` from some abstract class
``` ts
abstract class Base { 
  abstract getName(): string;
  printName() {}
}
class Derived extends Base {
  getName() {
    return "";
  }
}
// ---cut---
function greet(ctor: new () => Base) {
  const instance = new ctor();
  instance.printName();
}
greet(Derived);// it's concrete
greet(Base); //error, because it's abstract
```
