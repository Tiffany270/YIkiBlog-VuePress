# Build Performance

## The Basic
- stay up to the `lastest` webpack and node version
- Use the `include` field to only apply the loader modules that `actually` need to be transformed by it
``` js
const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  //...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        include: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
        loader: 'babel-loader',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
- increase `resolving(解析)` speed 
- Use the `DllPlugin` to move code that is changed less often into a separate compilation, it improve the application's `compilation` speed
- Try to keep chunks `small` by `SplitChunksPlugin` 

## Development
- webpack's `watch` mode
- `webpack-dev-server`
