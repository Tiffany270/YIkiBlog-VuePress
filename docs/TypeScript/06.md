# Modules
 `import` `export` `module.exports =` `export {}` `import *`
::: tip
`Modules` are executed within their `own` scope, not in the `global` scope. This means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are `not` visible outside the module unless they are explicitly `exported` using one of the `export` forms.   
Conversely, to `consume` a variable, function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, it has to be `imported` using one of the `import` forms
::: 
 - a file `without` any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a `script` whose contents are available in the `global scope`
 - any file `containing` a top-level `import` or `export` is considered a `module`

 ## ES Module Syntax
 - you can have `more` than one `export` of variables and functions via the `export`, but `MUST` by omitting `default` (one module only one default)
 ``` ts
 // @filename: hello.ts
export default function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
...
import hello from "./hello.js"; // hello as alias as default
hello();
//----------  mutilple export
// @filename: maths.ts
export var pi = 3.14;
export let squareTwo = 1.41;
export const phi = 1.61;
export class RandomNumberGenerator {}
export function absolute(num: number) {
  if (num < 0) return num * -1;
  return num;
}
...
mport { pi, phi, absolute } from "./maths.js";
console.log(pi);
const absPhi = absolute(phi);

```

## Import Syntax
``` ts
//------ rename
import { pi as π } from "./maths.js";
console.log(π);

//---- mix
import RNGen, { pi as π } from "./maths.js";

//---- all
import * as math from "./maths.js";

// ---- not include any variables , could trigger side-effects
import "./maths.js";

```

- `import type`
  - an `import` statement which can `only` import types
``` ts
// a.js
export type Cat = { };
export type Dog = { };
export const func = () => "fluffy";

import type { Cat, Dog } from "./a.js";
export type Animals = Cat | Dog; // ok

//cannot be used as a value because it was imported using 'import type'
import type { func } from "./a.js";
const name = func(); // error
```
  - but u can correct above using `inline type imports`
``` ts
import { createCatName, type Cat, type Dog } from "./animal.js"; // type X
 
export type Animals = Cat | Dog;
const name = createCatName();
```
- ES Module Syntax with `CommonJS` Behavior
  - directly correlates to a CommonJS and AMD `require`
  - ensures you have a` 1 to 1` match in your TypeScript file with the CommonJS output
``` ts
import fs = require("fs");
const code = fs.readFileSync("hello.ts", "utf8");
```

## CommonJS Syntax
- CommonJS is the `format` which most modules on `npm` are delivered in
- Even if you are writing using the ES Modules syntax above, having a brief understanding of how CommonJS syntax works will help you debug easier
- yiki: well, I don't really understand this part, pls view [offical docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/modules.html#commonjs-syntax) ... >.<!
