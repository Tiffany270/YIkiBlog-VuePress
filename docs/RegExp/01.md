# Detail

## The Full Stop
` . ` 
- matches `any` single character
- `not` match return or newline characters
- `.ar` means: `any` character, followed by the letter `ar`
  > ".ar" => The `car` `par`ked in the `gar`age 

## Character Sets
`  []  ` 
- Are also calledcharacter classes
- The `order` of the character range `inside` the square brackets `doesn't` matter
- `[Tt]he` means: an uppercase T `or` lowercase t, followed by the letter `he`
  > "[Tt]he" => `The` car parked in `the` garage
- `[.]` only means `.` inside `[]`
  >  A garage is a good place to park a c`ar.`

##  Negated Character Sets
`  [^ ]  `
-  [^c]ar means: any character `except` c, followed by the character ar
  > "[^c]ar" => The car `par`ked in the `gar`age

## Repetitions
 `  +  ` , `  *  ` or `  ?  `
- specify how many `times` a subpattern can occur

### The Star
`  *  `   
keywords: preceding 前缀 , 0 or more (0表示可以不存在噢)
- The `*` symbol matches `zero` or `more` repetitions of the preceding matcher 
- ` a*` means: `zero` or more repetitions of the preceding lowercase character a
- `[a-z]*` means: `any` number of lowercase letters in a row
  > "[a-z]*" => T`he car parked in the garage`

  > "\s*cat\s*" => The fat `cat` sat on the con`cat`enation.
- `.*` to match `any string` of characters 
- `\s` ( whitespace ) to match a string of `whitespace` characters
- `\s*cat\s*` means: zero or more spaces, followed by a lowercase `cat`, followed by zero or more `spaces`

### The Plus
 `  +  `  
 keywords: 1 or more, preceding , at least (至少出现一次)
- `c.+t` means: a lowercase c, followed by `at least` one character, followed by a lowercase t
  > "c.+t" => The fat `cat`

### The Question Mark
`  ?  `   
keywords: optional, 0 or one 
-  makes the preceding character optional
- `[T]?he` means: Optional uppercase T, followed by a lowercase he
  > "[T]?he" => `The` car is parked in t`he` garage

## Braces
`  { n,m }  `  `  { n }  `  `  {n, }  `  
keywords: at least,  not more than,  exactly n times
- `[0-9]{2,3}` means: Match `at least` 2 digits, but `not` more than 3, `ranging` from 0 to 9
  > "[0-9]{2,3}" => The number was 9.`999`7 , `10`.0  
  > "[0-9]{2,}" => The number was 9.`9997` , `10`.0  
  > "[0-9]{3}" => The number was 9.`999`7 , 10.0

## Capturing and Non-Capturing Groups
`  (...)  `,`  (?:...)  `
### Basic
`()\1`
- The number left behind `()` means the `order`
### Capturing
- Note that capturing groups do not only `match`, but also `capture`
- -  if we put a quantifier after a character then it will repeat the `preceding` character. But if we put a quantifier after a `capturing group` then it repeats the `whole` capturing group
  - `(ab)*` matches zero or more repetitions of the character "ab"
> "(c|g|p)ar" => The `car` is `par`ked in the `gar`age
### Non-Capturing
- A non-capturing group is a capturing group that `matches` the characters but `does not capture` the group
- `(?:c|g|p)ar` will not create a capture group
- 不考虑效率的场合，可以不用非捕获组，以提高正则表达式的可读性

## Alternation
`  |  `  
keywords : OR 
- character sets work at the `character level` but alternation works at the `expression level`
- `(T|t)he|car` means: either (an uppercase T or a lowercase t, followed by a lowercase he) OR (a lowercase car)
  > "(T|t)he|car" => `The` `car` is parked in `the` garage

## Escaping SP Characters
`  \  `   
keywords：转义
- note ： put it `before` your characters
- e.g `\.`

## Anchors
`  ^  `, `  $  `  
keywords : string, start, end 
- To check if the matching symbol is the `starting` symbol or `ending` symbol of the input string

### The Caret
- `^a` match `abc`
- `^b` not match anything
### The Dollar Sign
- `(at\.)$` means: a lowercase at, followed by a `·` character and the matcher must be at the `end` of the string
  > "(at\.)$" => The fat cat. sat. on the m`at.`  
  > "(at\.)" => The fat c`at.` s`at.` on the m`at.`
